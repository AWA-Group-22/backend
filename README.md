I'm developing a backend system for an order food app that allows admins to easily add new restaurants, set up menus, and track orders in real-time.
Customers can effortlessly order their favorite food from multiple restaurants and keep track of their order status. 
To ensure secure access, I'm using JWT authentication and a reliable MySQL database. I'm also using Cloudinary to handle images, delivering visually appealing graphics to enhance the user experience.
